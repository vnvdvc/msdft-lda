"""
solve the following optimization problem:

  minimize f(x)      subject to  c_i(x) > 0   for  i=1,...,m

where f(x) is a scalar function, x is a real vector of size n, and c_i(x) are the
m strict inequality constraints. The feasible space {x|C(x) > 0} is assumed to be convex.
The constraints are enforced by minimizing an auxiliary function f(x)+nu*B(x).
B(x) is the log-barrier

  B(x) = - sum_i log(c_i(x))

and `nu` is a small adjustable number.
